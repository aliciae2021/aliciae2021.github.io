    <p class="container">I am in my fourth year at California State University, San Bernardino studying for Computer Science bachelors. Most of my experience in coding comes from projects and assignments done in class, but I've also worked on a few personal projects. After I graduate, I hope to be a software engineer so I can apply and expand my technical skills in a real-world development environment. I really enjoy software development due to how it allows me to think outside the box and express my creative side.</p>
